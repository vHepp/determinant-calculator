# determinant-calculator

a C++ command line application for calculating the determinant of an NxN matrix consisting of integers read from test.txt, by converting to an upper triangular matrix and multiplying by a running constant of all the appropriate transformation effects on the final answer.

the first line of test.txt represents the dimensions of the NxN matrix
